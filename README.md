## Hi there 👋

I'm Yong Le! I'm a developer passionate about bringing ideas to life on the web, from the user interface right down to the database.

**Frontend**: I build interactive and dynamic UIs with React and TailwindCSS. 🎨

**Backend**: I have hands-on experience architecting server-side logic with both Express.js and Laravel. 🚀

**Databases**: I'm comfortable working with both SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases. 🗄️

The tech world moves fast, and I love being on that learning curve. I'm looking for an innovative team where I can contribute my skills, learn from others, and help build something awesome. Let's connect!

🎬 Kinopicks: A MERN Stack Movie Tracking App  
Kinopicks is a pet project that I built when I was exploring about web development. It is a full-stack web application built for movie enthusiasts to discover, rate, and track films. Developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and styled with Tailwind CSS, it provides a seamless and responsive user experience. Users can search a vast movie database, write comments, manage a personal watchlist, and handle their accounts with secure authentication, including an email-based password reset feature.

✨ Key Features:  
🔍 Movie Search: Dynamically search for movies via an external API (e.g., TMDB).  
⭐ Ratings & Reviews: Authenticated users can rate movies and post comments.  
🍿 Personalized Watchlist: Easily add or remove movies from a personal watchlist.  
🔐 User Authentication: Secure user registration, login, and session management using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).  
🔑 Password Reset: A "forgot password" flow that sends a secure reset link to the user's email.  
📱 Responsive Design: A mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS ensures a great experience on any device.
